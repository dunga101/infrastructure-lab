# Infrastructure Lab

This repository documents hands-on infrastructure labs built to develop and
demonstrate practical skills in Linux administration, virtualization,
networking, and security.

The focus is on building clean, reproducible server baselines and documenting
decisions, tradeoffs, and recovery strategies in a way that mirrors real-world
IT and infrastructure work.
